# List Processing

In this exercise we process data stored in a _List_, which
is an important concept in many programming languages.

In a file named `list_processing.py`, write a function named
`listproc` that:

- Takes two arguments, a list of String and a boolean flag.
- Returns a String that is the concatenation of the list values.
- If the flag is set to True, transform each list element which has an even index value to an uppercase String.

Calling `listproc(['one','two','three'], True)` returns `ONEtwoTHREE`,
for example.

## Mentoring topics

Discuss the use of lists, sets, and others similar structures.

## Test code

To validate your code, download the test code below and run
it as explained on the [Hello, Python](./hello_python.html)
exercise page.
