# Hello, Python: get acquainted with our exercises structure

In a file called `hello_python.py`, write a function that
returns `Hello, Python!`.

Use the test code below to validate your function.

The skeleton or your code is as follows:

    # hello_python.py
    def hello():
      # the exercise code goes here

Note that the lines starting with `#` in this skeleton
are _comment lines_, they are ignored by the Python
language executor but can help us understand the
code better.

There isn't much to program for this exercice, but it will
help you get used to the automated testing of
exercise results.

## Test code

To test your code, download [hello_python_test.py](./hello_python_test.py)
and run it with

    python hello_python_test.py

At this point you do not need to understand how the test code works,
but if you're curious it's not rocket science either.
