# A Calculator Function

In a file called `calculator_function.py`, 
write a `calc` function that executes
simple arithmetic operations, as follows:

- The function takes 3 arguments: number, operator (string), number
- It supports the four basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- It returns a number that is the result of the requested calculation

## Mentoring topics

Discuss what happens when a division by zero occurs, or
when the function arguments have invalid values, such as
an operator that is not one in the allowed list.

Future exercises will show how to cope with such
situations.

## Test code

To test your code, download [calculator_function_test.py](./calculator_function_test.py)
and run it with

    python calculator_function_test.py
