# Counting characters

In a file called `char_count.py`, write a function 
called `ccount`.

That function returns the string that was passed to it
as an argument, followed by a colon and
the number of characters in the string, also called
"string length".

If your function is called with `Yo, cats` for
example,it will return `Yo, cats:8`.

Use the test code below to validate your function.

The skeleton or your code is similar to the previous
exercises.

_Hint_: you might need to use `str()` to convert the string
length to a string.

## Test code

To validate your code, download the test code below and run
it as explained on the [Hello, Python](./hello_python.html)
exercise page.
