# Loop the loop

In this exercise we explore loops, an important concept
in any programming language.

In a file named `loop_theloop.py`, write a function named
`loop` that:

- Takes three integer arguments: start, end, step
- Returns the sum of all values generated by starting at _start_, adding _step_ at each iteration and stopping once the value is greater than or equal to _end_
- Uses 1 for the `step` value if the function is called with two arguments only

Calling `loop(2,13,4)` returns 18, for example, and calling 
`loop(2,5)` returns 9.

## Mentoring topics

Discuss what happens when you call `loop(2,13,-4)`, and how you
could avoid problems in such a case.

## Test code

To validate your code, download the test code below and run
it as explained on the [Hello, Python](./hello_python.html)
exercise page.

Test code:
