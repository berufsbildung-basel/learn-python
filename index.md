# Python Programming Exercises

![Happy Python]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/happy-python-tricycle.webp)

This website provides a series of exercices meant to teach
the basics of programming, in Python.

For more information about Python itself see the [Links](./links.html) page.

As of July 2024, our examples are tested with Python 3.12.3.

## How to use our exercise pages

Each exercise provides one or several Python code files,
that implement automated tests for the code that you have to write.

Follow the instructions on the exercise page
to download and run the corresponding test code.

Those tests will initially fail, until you supply
your own Python code file that follows the exercise
specifications and allows the tests to pass.
